# Ethereum Validator - Automated Install
Automated installation and configuration for Ethereum Validator using Geth & Lighthouse

Easily set up an Ethereum Validator in just 1 click, as opposed to hours spent on manual configuration.

# Summary
This Python script simplifies and automates the installation and configuration process of an Ethereum validator node.

It is based on [Somer Esat's - Lighthouse/Geth](https://someresat.medium.com/guide-to-staking-on-ethereum-ubuntu-lighthouse-773f5d982e03) guide and uses a single Python script to automate the entire process.

**Important Note:** This script does not handle generating validator keys, keystores, mnemonics, or any other security related items. It simply prepares the computer for staking by installing the binaries, creating users, writing service files etc. 

Once installed, Geth and Ligthouse Beacon will be properly configured and can begin syncing.

If you want to run a full validator, you'll also need to generate a mnemonic and keystores to run the validator. Please refer to [Somer's guide](https://someresat.medium.com/guide-to-staking-on-ethereum-ubuntu-lighthouse-773f5d982e03) or this [Ubuntu - Key Generation Guide](https://agstakingco.gitbook.io/eth-2-0-key-generation-ubuntu-live-usb/) to learn more.

# Validator Install Script
The `validator_install.py` script performs the following tasks:

1) Prompts user to select Ethereum network (mainnet / testnet).
2) Prompts user to set Ethereum address for validator tips (optional).
3) Prompts user to set Checkpoint Sync (optional).
4) Installs and configures Universal Firewall (ufw).
5) Creates necessary users, directories, and files.
6) Downloads and installs the latest Geth and Lighthouse binaries.
7) Sets up and writes service files for Geth, Lighthouse Beacon, and Lighthouse Validator.
8) Displays a summary of the installation.

**To run the script, use these commands:**

`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo pip install requests`

`sudo apt-get install git`

`git clone https://github.com/PyStakers/validator_install.git`

`python3 validator_install/validator_install.py`


**Disclaimer:** This script is for testing purposes only. Do not use on mainnet Validators.
